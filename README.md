Code Refactor Project 1
===========

## Description

In this bootcamp project, I learned to refactor the classes and ID's of this website to significantly simplify the style.css page, saving space and increasing readability while maintaining the correct styling. I caught and fixed many redundancies and removed unnecessary classes and ID's. For increased accessibility, I added alt tags and title text to every image in compliance with the ADA. I also moved sections of the CSS so the code appears in the same order that the corresponding element appears on the deployed webpage.

## Credits

The original (base) HTML and CSS were given to me by my instructors in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Bootcamp. My contribution was in refactoring, reordering elements, and adding accessibility features.

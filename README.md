Code Refactor Project
===========

## Description

In this project, I refactored the classes and ID's of this website to significantly simplify the CSS style page, while maintaining the correct styling. I fixed many redundancies and got rid of unnecessary classes and ID's. 


In addition, I added alt tags and title text to the images for increased accessibility.
